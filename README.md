It has almost been a year and half since the COVID-19 outbreak and people are still very much uncomfortablevisiting hospital for regular check-ups. I have made an arduino based medical device named Fit2Go to help those people overcome their fear. Wirth this devoce, they can easily measure their body temprature along with their pulse anytime. This project can help a lot of lderly people and can save a lot of money.
